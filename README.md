PD is the abbreviation for Placement Driver. It manages and schedules [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) clusters.

PD supports fault-tolerance by embedding [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd).

## Build

1. Make sure [*Go*](https://golang.org/) (version 1.19) is installed.
2. Use `make` to install PD. PD is installed in the `bin` directory.

## Usage

PD can be configured using command-line flags. For more information, see [PD Configuration Flags](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/command-line-flags-for-pd-configuration).

### Single node with default ports

You can run `pd-server` directly on your local machine. If you want to connect to PD from outside, you can let PD listen on the host IP.

```bash
# Set HOST_IP to the address you want to listen on
export HOST_IP="192.168.199.105"

pd-server --name="pd" \
          --data-dir="pd" \
          --client-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2379" \
          --peer-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2380" \
          --log-file=pd.log
```

```
export HOST_IP="11.158.168.215"
pd-server --name="pd" --data-dir="pd" --client-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2379" --peer-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2380" --log-file=pd.log
```

Using `curl` to view PD members:

```bash
curl http://${HOST_IP}:2379/pd/api/v1/members

{
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "pd",
      "member_id": 15980934438217023866,
      "peer_urls": [
        "http://192.168.199.105:2380"
      ],
      "client_urls": [
        "http://192.168.199.105:2379"
      ],
      "deploy_path": "/",
      "binary_version": "v6.1.3",
      "git_hash": "1a4e975892512a97fb0e5b45c9be69aa76148793"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also use [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) to call the API:

```bash
http http://${HOST_IP}:2379/pd/api/v1/members

{
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "pd",
      "member_id": 15980934438217023866,
      "peer_urls": [
        "http://192.168.199.105:2380"
      ],
      "client_urls": [
        "http://192.168.199.105:2379"
      ],
      "deploy_path": "/",
      "binary_version": "v6.1.3",
      "git_hash": "1a4e975892512a97fb0e5b45c9be69aa76148793"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Docker

You can choose one of the following methods to get a PD image:

- Build locally:

    ```bash
    docker build -t pingcap/pd .
    ```

- Pull from Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker pull pingcap/pd
    ```

Then you can run a single node using the following command:

```bash
# Set HOST_IP to the address you want to listen on
export HOST_IP="192.168.199.105"

docker run -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 --name pd pingcap/pd \
          --name="pd" \
          --data-dir="pd" \
          --client-urls="http://0.0.0.0:2379" \
          --advertise-client-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2379" \
          --peer-urls="http://0.0.0.0:2380" \
          --advertise-peer-urls="http://${HOST_IP}:2380" \
          --log-file=pd.log
```

### Cluster

As a component of the TiKV project, PD needs to run with TiKV to work. The cluster can also include TiDB to provide SQL services. For detailed instructions to deploy a cluster, refer to [Deploy a TiDB Cluster Using TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/production-deployment-using-tiup) or [TiDB on Kubernetes Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable).
